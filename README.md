# UcciLox

This is my implementation of the Lox interpreter from [craftinginterpreters.com](https://craftinginterpreters.com).
There's no support for classes or closures as I wasn't feeling like adding them.

I tried to add support for calling WinAPI functions via `GetModuleHandle` and `GetProcAddress` but unfortunately it didn't work out the way I wanted to.
